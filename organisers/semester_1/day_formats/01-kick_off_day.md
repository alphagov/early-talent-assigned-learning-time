[Slides](../../../2023-24--semester_1/presentations/2023-05-05%20-%20Day%201/001%20-%202023-05-05%20-%20Scope%20and%20Planning.pdf)

Standup followed an special format given it was the kick off.

Started by re-introducing the program:

- [Covering the aims]()
- Introductions
  - Who are you?
  - Where are you working?
  - How long have you been a dev
  - What's your favorite pancake topping
- [Plan for the semester](../semester_1.md)
- Plan for today
  - Focus on getting project ideas together
  - Cover the concept of User Needs, and how to make them central to your idea and planning
- Any questions?

### Pitch on Ideas

Aim is: To hone ideas for the semester

- Talk through what’s interesting
- Begin to think about how we’d do it
- Get a chance to get feedback early

Use the google hangout features to break folks into two person rooms.

One round looks like:

| Time   | Meeting           |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 5 mins | Person A Pitches  |
| 5 mins | Person B Responds |
| 5 mins | Person B Pitches  |
| 5 mins | Person A Responds |

Do one round for 20 mins.
Have a 10 min break.
Then do a second round shuffling the rooms so people are in with a new person.

Candidates were given instructions:

#### Your Turn to pitch

5mins - Can you explain the idea?

- What are you trying to make?
- What do you hope to learn from making it?
- What do you think will be the hardest part?
- What are the user needs you will need to have met?

#### Your Turn to respond

5mins - Help them think it through?

- Does the solution meet the user need?
- Why did they choose any technologies mentioned?
- What will be their first steps?
- How can they most quickly get to a MVP?
- What’s the first thing they should do afterwards

### Create repos & boards

Bring everyone back together and ask one candidate to share their screen.

Guide them through:

- Setting up a [new Repository on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) (and alphagov)
- Creating a [new github project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
- Talk about breaking down a ticket:
  - Good title
  - Good definition of "What"
  - Good definition of "Why" (look at those user needs!)
  - Good, clear, specific Acceptance Criteira
- Link to [a good GDS blog post on this](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/29/how-gov-uk-pay-used-behaviour-driven-development-to-improve-delivery-times/)

### Free Planning time

- Leave folks to freely plan their own tickets in line with guidance
- Offer appointment slots in Google Calendar for folks who want to discuss issues

### Tech talk

- End of the day tech talk on "Be a Good Git Citizen" ([slides](../../../2023-24--semester_1/presentations/2023-05-05%20-%20Day%201/002%20-%202023-05-05%20-%20Be%20a%20good%20Git%20Citizen.pdf)
