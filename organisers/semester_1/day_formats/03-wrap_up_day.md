# Kick off Day

## Summary

- Standard day following a consistent format
- Focus on progressing projects
- Focus on pairing opportunities and getting the cohort working together to solve problems

## Aim

Aims of the day are to cap off the learning period, allow for chances to reflect and take away key insights for future work.

In particular we are keen that learners get a chance to reflect on things that might be percieved as failure. Often there is fantastic learning from those "{x} was harder than I expected", "didn't anticipate {y}" that are valueable to reflect and remember for future planning.
