# Primary Developer

What is their role, and what are their responsibilities.

## Role

Primary developer is the core support for the learners on the project.
The role should be open to any who can contribute but will favour more senior technologists with greater expertise to share.

Primary developers do not need to be an expert in every area of technology that learners express an interest in, however they will need a broad base of skills, familiarity with industry best practices, the GDS Way and the service manual. A good primary developer will be confident in sharing knowledge and explaining technical concepts, organised and comfortable with repeated task switching, and with a strong sense of good patterns of working that can be applied to any development problem.

## Responsibilities

In practice the primary developer will:

- Understand a learners primary needs and objectives
- Help learners appropriately scope a project that is deliverable in the available time
- Help the learner with initial ticket breakdown into manageable chunks
- Organise rotating pairs within the first third of the period
- Run a daily standup
- Offer daily bookable appointment slots, allowing learners to request help in at predictable times
- Pair developers in the first third
- Monitor the slack channel, proactively suggest good resources and respond to queries
- Proactively organise longer one-to-one healthchecks with every learner to ensure they are - happy and on track
- Respond to requests for Pull Request reviews
- Organise a series of technical talks

## Time allocation

Based on the first semester this takes up:

20% of a developers time a week on the learning day, when no other work is possible
An additional 5% of time throughout the week on logistics and organising, weighted towards the start and end of a learning period

For a total of 25% of a mid / senior or lead developers time across a 14 week period (2 weeks to organize, 12 weeks delivery).
