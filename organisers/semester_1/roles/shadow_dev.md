# Shadow or Second Developer

What is their role, and what are their responsibilities.

## Role

The role of shadow developer is to provide backup to the [primary developer](./primary_dev.md) whilst also preparing to take on the cohort next semester.

It's intended that the shadow dev is a preparatory role, and that they would be the primary dev for the following semester.

## Responsibilities

The shadow will perform both understudy roles, working with the primary developer to ensure program coverage for planned absences. But also be ready to step in should unexpected absence occur.

On a day where they are providing cover they will need to be prepared to assume the responsibilities of the [primary developer](./primary_dev.md).

Outside of that time their main responsibilities will be:

- Stay aware of conversations in the main project slack channels
- Occasionally contribute to answer questions or post useful resources
- Occasionally attend standup or technical talks to stay aware of progress
- Attend the final day retro and show and tells
- Work with the primary dev on handover
- Assume the role of primary dev for next learning period.

## Time allocation

Shadow dev will generally not have allocated time to the project, and may wish to fit in occasioanl attendance and slack around their other duties.

They should budget time to attend the final day of a learning period as part of their handover.
They may also wish to attend the first day of a learning period to orient themselves.

All other time should vary depending on planned and unplanned absences of the primary dev.
