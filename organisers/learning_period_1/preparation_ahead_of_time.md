# Preparation for a new learning period

When a learning period comes to an end and we hand over to a new [primary dev](./roles/primary-dev.md), some actions will need to be taken to prepare for the next semester.

These are detailed here.

## Confirm the new cohort

The learning project is not mandatory, and learners should be enrolled each semester by their line managers. Use the [Junior List for assigned learning time sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1eIuUG9V6eHlT0w2kfNRGNfnBkOvG63EgJv_dGnV2I/edit#gid=0) (restricted access) to find key contacts.

You'll need to email the Line managers and ask if they would like to re-enroll their line reports

## Update the teams, groups and slack

Update the [google group](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/g/assigned-learning-time-current-cohort/members) and [github team](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/teams/early-talent-learning-cohort) with the final candidate list.

Move any who have left the program to an alumni channel (not created yet as of first learning period)

Add any new learners to the project slack.

## Hold a kick off session for new learners

Meet with any new learners head of the start date and go over the program and it's aims

## Prepare learning docs with candidates

Ask learners to work with line managers to scope out their learning needs (ideally these would correspond with line management objectives).

Ask them to suggest projects, also suggest one or two projects that speak to their interest either based on past successful projects from learners, or template ones.

Send these out in advance and ask learners to come prepared on the first day to confirm their project, it's aims and begin breaking down the work onto tickets.

## Arrange tech talks

Arrange a technical talk for 15:30 every learning day.
Prepare to give a few talks yourself to fill any gaps.

Work with the wider tech community to invite all other Juniors who are not learning cohort members.

Also put a shout out in slack in #tech-community as the open invite.
And thank speakers in #appreciations after they've given their time.

## Arrange support with Delivery managers where needed

We've found that the dev can run standup most days.
Bring in a DM to help with specific issues, but ideally get one to voulenteer time for any specific workshops or the end of learning period retro.
