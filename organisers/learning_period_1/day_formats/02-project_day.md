# Kick off Day

## Summary

- Standard day following a consistent format
- Focus on progressing projects
- Focus on pairing opportunities and getting the cohort working together to solve problems

## Aim

The standard day format for Semmester one.
Tried first on 2023-05-12 but expected to follow a similar format for the following six days.

Core aims to set up a space to both give candidates enough time to progress projects, but provide a light structure around which they can get together with others and unblock problems between themselves or share best practice.

## What did we cover?

| Time          | Meeting                                    | Notes |

## Standup

Format depends on preference of the DM.

Initial standup was confounded by DM not having access to all the Github Project Boards (woops).
So format was an alphabetical order whip around of what you hope to achieve today and flagging potential blockers.

As the first in the series the DM also give some helpful tips for a successful standup:

Grouped around the 4 Ps

1. **Preparation**: Think about your update in advance
   Think about what you have been doing and what you want to share with the rest of the team, don’t just run in the door, into the stand-up and say the first thing you can remember.
2. **Prioritisation**: Don’t talk about ALL the things
   Not everything is relevant or valuable to everyone else, talk about the most important things that other people need to know or things you need help with. Keep the current goal in mind too.
3. **People**: Talk to the team, not to the leader (scrum master, agile coach etc)
   This isn’t a status meeting, this is a chance to talk to the team, so talk to the team and listen to each other.
4. **Problems**: Raise issues and help each other
   The stand-up is the place to say when you are blocked or stuck, but don’t wait to be asked, it’s also a great place to offer help to each other.

## Assign Pairing groups

The cohort should be divided into two.
This allows the covering dev to offer more targeted appointment slots across the day to cater for those doing focused work.

One half, spends the morning pairing, and the afternoon on solo work.
The other half, spends the morning on solo work, and afternoon pairing.

Efforts should be made to juggle:

- Assigning people to different pairs each week (keep a note of past assignments for this)
- Taking into account circumstances which means a preference for morning / afternoon (within reason, put a shout out early in the day)
- Absences or odd numbers of candidates, drop in to pair or set up a three where numbers don't match

Announce the pairing in the slack channel.

## Pairing / Work time

### Pairing group

Are given guidance on pairing:

- [GDS - How to pair program effectively in 6 steps](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/06/how-to-pair-program-effectively-in-6-steps/)
- [Thoughtbot - How to Get Better at Pair Programming](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-get-better-at-pair-programming)

Then set off. Ideally both would install each others projects and switch between "driving" and "navigating" for their half of the session.

At the half way mark, the pair should switch from targeting one person's project to looking at the other persons project.

In practice early pairing sessions involved more discussion of work and approaches and less actual coding. That is fine where it helps target work better.

### Solo work group

Allowed time to work on and progress their projects.

Appointment slots should be in the calendar (set to 15 mins), for quick 1-to-1 sessions to consult with the primary developer.
From week 3 onwards, Primary developer should pre-book a number of 1-to-1s aiming to get around the entire cohort, whilst leaving space for folks to book on the day.

Use the 1-to-1 and appointment slots to build a picture of what's going well, and the slack channel to encourage individuals with overlapping questions and soluitions to get in touch and help each other.

## Tech Talk

Run a tech talk at 15:30 to cap off the day with an interesting topic.
